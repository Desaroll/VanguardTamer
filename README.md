# VanguardTamer

VanguardTamer is a small utility designed to control Vanguard's (Valorant Anticheat system) behaviour.

Default Vanguard's behaviour can be percieved as intrusive, so this utility is designed to control some of it, specially those which the Vanguard Tray icon doesn't provide options for.

Actually, it can:
1) Stop Vanguard from running (If you closed the system tray, it's not that easy).
2) Stop Vanguard from starting with Windows (Meaning you'll need to use option 3 to be able to play Valorant again).
3) Setup Vanguard to start with Windows (After a restart you should be able to play Valorant)
